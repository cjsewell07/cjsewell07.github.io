            <h2>Hello, thank you for looking at my page. Let me tell you about myself. I am an undergraduate student
                persuing his Engineering degree, in the field of Computer Engineering, at 
                Texas A&M Univeristy. </h2>
            <h2>I am a fun and an exciting person to be around. I am a hard worker and enjoy both software and hardware
                side of computer engineering. I enjoy Computer Engineering as a major, because I always had a love of coding and 
                 had an interest with hardware functionality in electronics. In essence, the main things that interest me in this major
                is the ability to work on many things that can relate with each other. Whether this is building a website, 
                making an algorthm for computer components, or making the computer components work with the code that is 
                designed with them. All of these areas of interest is what makes me pursue a Computer Engineerign degree. </p>
            <h2>My hobbies are as follows: drawing, anime, video games, playing music, and doing projects.</h2> 
            <h2>A cool fact about me is that I tend to increase my workload to the limit, since I always look
                for tasks to do in my freetime.
            </h2>
